  <h1>Samuel Taylor Coleridge</h1>

<p>

Coleridge lived a moderately long (1772-1834) but nevertheless turbulent life -- his was possibly one of the saddest life stories in English poetry. Like Wordsworth, Coleridge lost a parent early, with his father dying when Coleridge was nine; adding to his difficulties, he became emotionally estranged from his mother and performed poorly at school. He married Sara Fricker in 1795; having moved near Wordsworth between 1800-04, he then subsequently fell unhappily in love with Wordsworth's sister-in-law, Sarah Hutchinson (a relationship that is referred to his poem "Dejection: An Ode"). By the time he separated from his wife in 1806, he was far gone on an opium addiction, which he started taking early in life to address an ongoing psychosomatic illness; the drug seemed to accentuate his temperamental dreaminess. He died in London, from heart failure, in July of 1834.
