  <h2>The Client</h2>

<p>
My client was very specific about wanting an extremely simple site that showed only the three mantis shrimp she currently has available and a few of her favorite mantis-related comics/informational videos.  This is a for-fun site because she only has one friend who likes to purchase mantis shrimp as pets and she wanted to make the experience fun for him.
