**Web Browsers**

A request is sent over the network to a server.  The server responds with content which is interpreted by your browser, which then displays it.  The rendering engine takes in both css and html documents, and displays them on the UI (html is used to markup content, and css is to style and animate). The browser engine directs acitons between the UI, the rendering engine, and server communications.
   I (and most other humans I know) use Chrome almost exclusively for browsing.  If that's wrong I don't wanna be right.

**Markup Language**

 HTML is agreed-upon, for the most part, as the go-to markup language.  It is the one that is most commonly used.  It uses tags to describe how the structure of the page should appear. The tags are not meant to be visible to the viewer, they're there to provide the building block elements necessary to set up a page in an organized manner.
