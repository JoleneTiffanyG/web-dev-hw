  <h2>The Client</h2>

<p>
My client was very specific about wanting an extremely simple site that showed only the three mantis shrimp she currently has available and a few of her favorite mantis-related comics/informational videos.  This is a for-fun site because she only has one friend who likes to purchase mantis shrimp as pets and she wanted to make the experience fun for him.

<h2>Work Cycle</h2>
 My work cycle this round consisted of doing some brainstorming and research into my favorite animal.  Fortunately, everything I used for this site came from stuff I have finally committed to memory.  Less fortunately, my brain is fried and it's likely it didn't quite satisfy every requirement.  But I'm giving it my best and I have learned a lot in this class.  Thanks so much for the super intuitive and awesome structure of the material, it took off about eighty percent of the possible stress of trying to get everything semi-finished and learned at the last minute.
