  <h2> Head and Body Elements</h2>

<p>

**Head elements** are where we put cursory initial information, and the **body elements** are the so-called "meat and potatoes" where we put the main substantive content of the page.  The head is an element for <cite>"processing information and document metadata,"</cite> according to an inside source.  I'm not sure how the metaphor of the head as the thoughts of the page figures into the whole "meat and potatoes" analogy, but I suppose bodies are made of meat, after all.  The only compulsory element of the head is the singular **title** element.  Whereas the head tends to contain metadata for the site and elements not intended for the prying eyes of the user, the content within the **body** element is the stuff that is meant to be rendered and displayed to the viewer.

  <h2>Structural Vs. Semantic Markup</h2>

  <p>

  **Structural markup** holds information about the structure of a document (things such as headings, paragraphs, breaks and lists). These are things that help to visually guide the viewer as well as provide information about the the type of content in a document. Conversely, **semantic markup** is used to reinforce the *meaning* of the information contained in a document. (Nice, I automatically used italics there before I even finished reading about what semantics was. So, great accidental example of semantics markup!)

<h2>Work Cycle</h2>

  <p>
  My work cycle for this assignment, as it has for each of the previous assignments, consisted of going through each step on each page of the website, following the tutorial instructions and reading the information provided.  To make things easier with formatting, and so as not to forget any of the main components, I have gotten into the habit of copying and pasting each assignment folder and then deleting the content and reformatting as needed.  Sure, maybe, it's a cheap shortcut, but it helps reiterate what each of the basic components are, and it saves a ton of time as opposed to going back to each previous lesson to get a reminder on how to do embed a photo or indent a paragraph, or any other basic pieces that are taking their sweet time being committed to memory.  I then looked up a recipe and copied all of the relevant information into my index.html and then reformatted it as specified.
