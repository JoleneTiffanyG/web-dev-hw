# Assignment II
## Tiffany Gross

  I decided to take this class because I'm getting an entire degree in a semester and a half, and this is what was available for the summer.  BUT I am _excited_ that I was forced to take this class because I actually thought it was a Web Design class, and when I realized it was web *development* I nearly cried because I had such a difficult time the last time I took a coding class.  But now, with everything so clearly laid out, this somehow just flipped into being the coolest class ever.  Not to mention I was avoiding any paid web design prospects because I didn't think it was feasible, and now that blockade has lifted and it suddenly looks so doable! I'm super stoked on this.
