Data travels on the Internet by way of packets of information, by constantly changing routes. Bits of information are distributed into packets, each of which has the IP address of its origin and its destination.  Each router keeps track of multiple possible paths and chooses the quickest/easiest route for the data to travel.

DNS servers are themselves connected to each other to be able to handle the sheer amount of information.
