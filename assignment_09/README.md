  <h2>Selector Types</h2>

<p>
**Universal** selectors style *every* element on a page.  An **element** selector is used to select all elements of a certain specified kind.  **Class** selectors can be used to select elements that serve a shared function.  An **id** selector allows us to define style rules for a specified element by calling its single unique ID (#).

  <h2>My Color Palette</h2>

According to my thorough research, the 40's were a pretty drab time.  But like, pastel-style drab.  There were lots of muted colors.  Chrome also started becoming a popular thing in the forties, but I could not figure out a realistic way to use chrome as a color and it looked weird throwing in a chrome image.  The colors I ended up using were dark or muted variations of yellow, green and blue. Specifically; rgb(115,136,165) for my blue background, hex #7BC17E for my green text, and rgba(207, 179, 50, .8) for my text rectangles (the fourth digit deals with opacity, I wanted it to be muted slightly further to blend with the background scheme).

<h2>Work Cycle</h2>

  <p>
  Once again, my work cycle for this assignment consisted of going through each step on each page of the website, following the tutorial instructions and reading the information provided. I had to reference back to earlier HTML stuff quite a bit so my work cycle included cycling between about thirteen open tabs.  The most frustrating thing, which is becoming more of an issue the further we get into things, is that pushing my changes and having the live site actually update itself accordingly leaves a LOT of lag time.  I tried a few different things with fetching origin and refreshing the Git page, and I'm pretty sure my internet can't possibly be *that* slow or I'd be noticing it elsewhere, so I'm not sure what's taking five to ten minutes for each update.  I definitely had to make a lot of guesses due to the lack of instantaneous visibility, so getting the right RGB values especially took a lot of careful adjustment.
