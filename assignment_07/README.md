  <h1>README Assignment 7</h1>


  <h2>Divs, Classes, Ids, and Spans</h2>

<p>
Ids are global identifiers- unique identifying attributes that are specific to the given element.
The class attribute groups similar types of elements together by using the same name value, allowing for easy styling of those elements.
Divs can be either nested within one another or standalone. Divs are mostly used for the purpose of structural clarity and to identify element groups, increasing readability.
The span element is similar to the div element.  Spans can exist inside of divs and they do not create full-width blocks.  For content that may be in need of extra organization or styling, spans can identify or group said content together.
</p>


  <h2>Alt Text</h2>

  <p>
  The alt attribute specifies alternative text for an image (or whatever it may be) that will be there in the case that an image is unable to be displayed. Text should be descriptive.

<h2>Work Cycle</h2>

  <p>
  Once again, my work cycle for this assignment consisted of going through each step on each page of the website, following the tutorial instructions and reading the information provided.  I ran into huge issues this assignment, all of them to do with embedding.  I missed something fundamental about how to embed the code I get from the source, and I am unable to view the content of the media file download (I'm not sure if looking at the code therein was supposed to serve as an example of how it should look? but it just looks like a bunch of weird symbols, like when you send a text with an emoji in it to someone who has an old flip phone and none of the content can be translated).  So, I feel like I get everything except that one super basic part of embedding that is absolutely vital for almost every step of this project.
