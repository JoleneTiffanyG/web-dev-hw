  <h1>README Assignment 6</h1>


  <h2>Forms</h2>

<p>
There are obviously endless examples of forms we see everyday on the web.  Basically anytime we interact or input information into a site, it's by way of a form.  Basically everything on Moodle, from logging in to taking quizzes and submitting homework assignments, is done by way of a form.  All text entry, buttons, radio checkmarks, uploads, dropdown boxes, etc.
</p>


  <h2>Text, Selection, and Button Inputs</h2>

  <p>
An example of text input is when we type our usernames into Moodle for login. Text input can be more limited or more open according to what the coder desires.  An example of selection input is when you are filling out a survey and choose either M or F (or if it's a somewhat better establishment, there will be other selection choices or a text input option here).  An example of a button input is right now after I add the links to my repo and live site, I will hit the Add Submission button to perform the predetermined action of submitting an assignment for evaluation.

<h2>Work Cycle</h2>

  <p>
  Once again, my work cycle for this assignment consisted of going through each step on each page of the website, following the tutorial instructions and reading the information provided. I used the book more this time to remind myself of some of the fundamentals from earlier sessions, and also to look up alternative methods of things that were giving me problems.  I ran into two main issues during this assignment.  Firstly, specifying columns did not work for me at all.  I did a lot of troubleshooting on this, and it seems to be a pretty frequently confronted issue.  Some of the common fixes included specifying font family, and using CSS to specify width with em and ex units (I'm not sure if that last thing even made sense to try here, but I got a little lost and was just trying out the most frequently suggested fixes for the issue- regardless, it did not work).  The second issue was that I wanted a cooler-looking Submit button, but formatting the image in the way you had it in the example showed up nothing, and I tried doing it the book way and it just showed the text I had in the alt area instead of the button itself.  So, with that one I ended up leaving the original boring Submit button since it's clickable, but I left the pretty red one on there as decoration.  I realize that would be misleading on an actual website, and I definitely have to get that issue figured out at some point (I left a note in my assignment, I know this is all last minute crunch-time but when you get around to it if you're able to see what's wrong I would love to know so if I end up trying to make anything in real life I'm not stil hung up on such a basic problem).  Anyway, after troubleshooting for a while on these issues, I wrapped it all up the best I could, pushed changes to GitHub, and submitted the repo and live site for grading. (technically that is still a future part of my work cycle, but it is expected to occur within the next two minutes).
