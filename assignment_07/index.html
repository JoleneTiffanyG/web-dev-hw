<h2>Lyrics</h2>
<div id="lyrics"
class="container lyrics">
I know there's something wrong stop making it up <br>
We're too proud to see we've lost more than our trust<br>
And now there's nothing left, well's dead and dried up<br>
Its disease has left a foul taste in our cup<br>
It just keeps on flowing<br>
And we drift on knowing<br>
It just keeps on flowing<br>
This babble from our mouth<br>
Who we are I fear most of the time<br>
Carry on shuffling in order and in line<br>
Who we are I fear most of the time<br>
Carry on whipping boy, stare into the light<br>
Stare into the light<br>
And it feels familiar for good reason<br>
I want us to break the case we're in<br>
With one of the tools of this catatonic skin<br>
Remove all the parts<br>
I want us to face the shape we're in<br>
A world of confusion awaits our sons and kin<br>
Lets reset it all<br>
Lets reset it all<br>
Well it stings and it hurts, is this how it's meant to be<br>
Well it stings and it hurts, is this how it's meant to be<br><br>
Well it stings and it hurts, a small price to pay to be<br>
In control and rebirth what our future's meant to be<br>
Who we are I fear most of the time<br>
So carry on whipping boy, stare into the light<br>
I want us to face the shape we're in<br><br>
A world of confusion awaits our sons and kin<br>
Let's reset it all (we are, we are, we are)<br>
Let's reset it all (we are, we are, we are)<br>
These words of wisdom come with lack of vision<br>
This is the first day I've ever had to stand and witness<br>
These words of wisdom come with lack of vision<br>
This is the first day I've ever had to stand and witness<br>
These words of wisdom come with lack of vision<br>
This is the first day I've ever had to stand and witness<br>
These words of wisdom come with lack of vision<br>
This is the first day I've ever had to stand and witness<br>
These words of wisdom come with lack of vision<br>
This is the first day I've ever had to stand and witness
