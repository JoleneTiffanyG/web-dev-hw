  <p>
Thank you so much for emailing us those walkthroughs!  I wanted to just go through the assignments as I had been, but for this particular assignment the walkthrough was a huge lifesaver.  My work cycle was to follow along your video, change the specifics to the colors/sizes/fonts that I felt matched the ambience I was going for with the poem I chose, and then after that I went through the materials and added things in as needed.
