  <h1>README Assignment 6</h1>


  <h2>HTML Recap</h2>

<p>

This was pretty much all brand new except some of the basic code formatting ideas of which I had some (very vague) memories.  As I'm sure you can see by my site, I had some difficulty understanding a few placement issues, and ended up going working around these issues in ways that I'm sure were way more difficult than if I just understood doing it the right way.  I'm really glad you had us purchase the book so that I can revisit the things I'm still struggling with after I've had some sleep and am working less than sixty hours a week.  This whole HTML section/entire class is of the utmost interest to me, and despite the glaringly obvious hiccups I'm super stoked to have actually made a site and gotten that first messy project out of the way.  It is *so* vastly helpful with the whole creative block issue to just be forced to dive into a thing and go ahead and mess up and make mistakes and learn.

  <h2>On CSS and Anxiety</h2>

  <p>
I definitely have some misgivings concerning getting into CSS for the first time over the span of a day and a half, and I sure hope I've learned some sort of deeply ingrained unconscious lesson about time allocation.  My personal issues with time management aside, however, I am SUPER stoked to get into the decor elements of site design.  Obviously that's always the part of a project that sounds like the most fun, and I'm hoping that holds true in this case.  Either way, though, super stoked to learn about it!

<h2>Work Cycle</h2>

  <p>
My work cycle for this one was a little erratic, since it was comprised of putting together everything we've learned so far AND trying to put together a reasonable tutorial-style site.  I  definitely spent waaaay too much time in the beginning focused on actually teaching a newbie how to wire wrap.   Then I realized I had chosen a terrible skill on which to focus for an assignment of this sort, realized it was too late to narrow my focus without throwing everything out, and tried to just keep my mind on the site building aspects.  This definitely made for a scattered and pretty unhelpful site as far as actually learning a skill is concerned.  I pulled it together well enough that technically a person could still learn from the materials and links shared, but I sure wouldn't recommend it unless there weren't many other options.  I know that if I tried again with a much simpler topic I would be able to focus more on the site elements and make something a lot more organized and nicer looking.  So, bad project, but great lesson.  And since that's the point of school, I'm super cool with it :)
