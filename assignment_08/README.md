  <h2>Fonts</h2>

<p>

The main difference between as system font and a web font is that a system font is designed to be installed on your device and is ready for use in applications also installed on your system.  A web font is usually served in four formats (TrueType, WOFF, EOT and SVG).  A web-safe font is one that is likely that most computers visiting your site will have installed so the browser can use it.

  <h2>Fallback Fonts and Font Stacks</h2>
Fallback or font stacks are used in the eventuality that the primary font fails for whatever reason.  In this case, the fallback option will step in and that is what will be visible to the viewer.

<h2>Work Cycle</h2>

  <p>
Thank you so much for emailing us those walkthroughs!  I wanted to just go through the assignments as I had been, but for this particular assignment the walkthrough was a huge lifesaver.  My work cycle was to follow along your video, change the specifics to the colors/sizes/fonts that I felt matched the ambience I was going for with the poem I chose, and then after that I went through the materials and added things in as needed.
