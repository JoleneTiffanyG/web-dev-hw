<p>

Wire wrapping is a super fun hobby (and one of few hobbies in my life that can be taught or explained in a step-by-step manner).  It has become a great asset monetarily, and hopefully soon traditional-style jobs and employers will be a thing of the past.  To learn more about wire wrapping, you can either do it the way my partner and I did and just look at some pieces you admire and start winging it, or you can purchase and view tutorials (I highly recommend Imnium, she's an incredible artist and really great at teaching.  Links to her work and tutorials can be found on the home page of my site!)
